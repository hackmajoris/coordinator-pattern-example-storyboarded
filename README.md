[Example](https://github.com/hackmajoris/coordinator-pattern-example-programmatic) without storyboard.

A Coordinator is an object the encapsulates a lifecycle that is spread over a collection of view controllers.
"So what is a coordinator? A coordinator is an object that bosses one or more view controllers around. Taking all of the driving logic out of your view controllers, and moving that stuff one layer up is gonna make your life a lot more awesome"
